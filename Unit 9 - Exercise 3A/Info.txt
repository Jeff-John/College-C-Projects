35.3 Unit 9 - Exercise 3A (4/15)
In this exercise, you will have to complete the class Course. Course has 5 private attributes:

code (string)
section (int)
maxStudents (int): the maximum number of students in the course
numStudents(int): the number of students currently in the course
roster (*string): pointer to dynamically allocate the list of students (array of size maxStudents)
Add the following methods to the class:

Constructor with three parameters (string, int, int). The string parameter is the code of the course, the first integer parameter is the section number, and the second integer parameter is the maximum number of students. If the last integer parameter is not positive, set it to be 10. In this function, you must also set the current number of students to 0 and allocate the roster array.
Copy constructor. Make sure to produce a deep copy.
Operator =. Make sure to produce a deep copy and no memory leaks.
Operator ==. This operator compares 2 Course objects and returns true if the code and section are equal.
Destructor. Delete all dynamic memory.
Do not modify the functions already given to you. You can leave the main function empty or use it for your own development/testing, but do not delete it.

Deviating from the instructions (e.g. changing the function parameters) will result in partial or complete point deduction, proportional to the severity of the infraction.
