33.3 Unit 7 - Exercise 3A (4/1)

Define an Employee class that contains:

(1) three private member variables: name (string), salary (float), and startYear (int)

(2) the corresponding accessors and mutators for the above member variables in the public section

string getName(); return the value of the name variable
float getSalary(); return the value of the salary variable
int getStartYear(); return the value of the startYear variable
void setName(string); set the name variable
void setSalary(float); set the salary variable
void setStartYear(int); set the startYear variable
(3) two constructors

the default constructor that sets name as "Unknown", salary as 0, startYear as 2021
an overloaded constructor that takes three parameters as input in the order of a string, a float, and an integer, then sets the three private member variables defined above
(4) one public function void printOut() that outputs the information of an employee in the following format:

<name> joined the company in <startYear>, current salary: <salary>
salary should be output with double digit precision.

In the main() function,

declare an Employee object and set its member variables' values according to the user input with the following format
<name>
<startYear>
<salary>
employee's name may contain whitespaces. The program then outputs the following

Added new employee <name> with entrance salary: <salary>
salary should be output with double digit precision.

declare an Employee array with 4 elements where appropriate to make the remaining code work
The main is commented in the initial template to allow you to test the class first (Test cases 1-5). After passing these test cases, uncomment and complete the main. Uncommenting the main while your class is still incomplete will lead to compiler errors.
